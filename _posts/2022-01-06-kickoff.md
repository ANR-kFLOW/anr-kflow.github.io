We are very proud to announce the kick-off of the Knowledge Flow research project, acronym: kFLOW. This project is inscribed in the field of artificial intelligence, with the goal of combining NLP, Knowledge Graphs and Deep Learning techniques to extract information about events and -above all- the relationships between them.

This project stems from the awareness that our knowledge is based on a succession of events. Understanding the relationships between them helps us to better understand the world in which we live. Following the wisdom of the ancients:

kFLOW is funded by the [JCJC](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/appel-a-projets-generique-2021) (Jeunes Chercheurs - Jeunes Chercheuses) program of the French National Research Agency ([Agence Nationale de la Recherce, ANR](https://anr.fr)), for the duration of 3 years, starting from January 2022.

We are looking forward to make exiting research... and add a further node in the Knowledge Flow.
