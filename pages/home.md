**Latest News**: EKAW team will be at EKAW 2022.

Human History is composed of a **continuous flow of events**. Each of them can impact subsequent events and contribute to the evolution of human knowledge.

kFLOW is a research project aiming to propose strategies for representing, extracting, predicting and using the information about **event relationships and knowledge evolution**. For achieving these goals, we are realising a Knowledge Graph of interconnected events and facts, developing specialised strategies for:
- data modelling
- information extraction
- link prediction
- incorrect triple detection and automatic fact-checking
